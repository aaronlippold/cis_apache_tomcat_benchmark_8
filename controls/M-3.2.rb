  desc  "Tomcat listens on TCP port 8005 to accept shutdown requests. By
connecting to this port and sending the SHUTDOWN command, all applications
within Tomcat are halted. The shutdown port is not exposed to the network as it
is bound to the loopback interface. If this functionality is not used, it is
recommended that the Shutdown port be disabled. Disabling the Shutdown port
will eliminate the risk of malicious local entities using the shutdown command
to disable the Tomcat server. "
